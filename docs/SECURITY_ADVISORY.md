# Security Advisory - December 2024

## Critical Vulnerability Remediation

### High Severity Issues Resolved

#### 1. ECDSA Library Vulnerabilities (CVE Pending)

**Affected Package**: `python-jose` -> `ecdsa@0.19.1`

**Vulnerabilities**:
- **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data** (CVSS 7.4): Insufficient protection allows private key reconstruction from a single operation
- **Timing Attack** (CVSS 7.4): Timing signatures can leak internal nonce, enabling private key discovery

**Resolution**: 
- Replaced `python-jose` with `PyJWT>=2.8.0`
- PyJWT uses the `cryptography` library backend which is actively maintained and secure
- No functionality loss as `python-jose` was not actively used in the codebase

**Impact**: Eliminates risk of private key exposure in JWT operations

### Kubernetes Security Hardening

#### 2. Sealed Secrets Controller RBAC

**Issue**: ClusterRole with overly broad secret permissions

**Resolution**:
- Removed ALL secret permissions from ClusterRole
- Implemented namespace-specific Roles for `business-intelligence` and `monitoring`
- Applied principle of least privilege

#### 3. Container Security

**Issues**: Multiple container security misconfigurations

**Resolutions**:
- Non-root user enforcement (UID 10001)
- Read-only root filesystem
- Dropped all Linux capabilities
- Privilege escalation prevention
- Image version pinning with Always pull policy

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions**:
   - Update all environments to use PyJWT instead of python-jose
   - Apply new RBAC configurations to production clusters
   - Review and apply container security contexts

2. **Ongoing Security**:
   - Regular dependency scanning with Snyk
   - Quarterly security audits
   - Automated vulnerability scanning in CI/CD
